# surf-school

I built a dummy surf school website for the fictional West Point Surf School in Cornwall.

When building the project I was fully focused on using my newly learnt Bootstrap 5 skills.

I've not customised the websites look so the base colours are all standard Bootstrap options. 

My real focus was on the page layout and changing the way the page appeared dependent on screen size.
